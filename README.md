# memoGame
Simple Memo Game - HTML, CSS, JS (jQuery)

Just like in the title - it's a simple and well-known Memo Game. Set number of pieces, click "new game" and start finding twin tiles. You uncover hidden tiles by clicking them. When you uncover two the same tiles - they stay uncovered, otherwise the next mouse click will hide them again. Play until you find the last pair of tiles.

Score shows number of your clicks. Lower score is better...

Have fun.
